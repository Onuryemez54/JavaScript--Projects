This repository contains some small projects I created with html, css and javascript.

Accordion: It is a simple application that shows the content of the clicked title when you click on the titles.

Carousel: An application that scrolls the images on the home page using buttons that allow you to move to the next image or the previous image.

Form Validation: It is an application that displays a warning in case of missing or incorrect user input before the form is sent.

Random Quote Machine: An application that shows the next quote and its author in different colors when you click on the new quote button on the home page.

Todolist: Application that allows the user to create a to-do list and cross off or delete any list item.

Random Image: An application that allows different images to appear on the screen each time you click on the Fetch images button on the page, using api.unsplash.com.

note: Please enter your own api key for the random image project
